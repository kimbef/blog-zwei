[] - When a user open the dashboard should be able to see both events and posts at one place, but also should be able to filter search choosing from options           [ events , posts , events the user will attend ( тоест на които вече е отбелязал, че ще присъства , но евентуално може да е забравил, по този начин може да провери дали има текущи евенти които очакват неговото присъствие ), и 4тият последен филтър ще бъде да покаже всички евенти които usera е отбелязал, че няма да присъства ].

[] - Events which date has passed should be added automatically to old events page, and every other event that is upcoming in date should be added to future events page. When the happening of the event is about to happen for example let say 01.01 that means that on first of january the event should be automatically removed from future events, and must be added to current events until end of the day. On the next day 02.01 the event must be added automatically to old events.
